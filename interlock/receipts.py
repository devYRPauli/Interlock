"""
Receipts anyone can check, without trusting whoever hands them over.

A receipt bundle is every journal entry for one effect. Each entry carries the hash of
the entry before it, so an edited, removed or reordered entry breaks the chain. verify()
re-derives the claims from the entries themselves rather than reading a summary:

    happened             committed (True), refused or never sent (False), or nobody can know ("unknown")
    happened_once        this effect id committed at most once, never sent while an earlier send was unresolved.
                         True on an effect that never fired. It is about this one effect id: it does not show that
                         no other effect id (another request, another integration, a hand refund) did the same thing
    authorized_when_fired  the lease check recorded immediately before every send passed, and the grant
                         record read with it (if any) shows it unrevoked and covering the amount
    assumptions_held     the premises were re-checked immediately before every send, with no violations
                         (none means the target read the recorded premises back unchanged)
                         (both None when nothing fired: a send later refused at recovery never landed)
    refused              the last refusal's reason, when the effect did not happen
    evidence             what the target returned for the commit (e.g. Stripe's refund id), or what a lookup found
    rechecked_at_recovery  the last re-check recovery recorded, including a failed one before a lookup
                         found the effect had already landed
    approved_by          the person whose lease the landed send went out under (None for policy)
    approval_verified    once escalated, every decision answers the latest escalation, from someone it was
                         routed to, before a send citing it on the facts it showed (None: never escalated)
    escalations          who each escalation went to, why, what changed, and who decided it
    confirmed_by_target  the target's own last word, by status precedence since Stripe delivers out of order:
                         True, False, "pending" or None

A person lease with no escalation on a chain with no ESCALATED or DECIDED is a legacy approval and
is not checked against decisions. Without a signature, whoever controls the journal can strip the
escalations off a chain and make it look legacy.

With a key, the bundle is signed (HMAC-SHA256 over the effect id and the last hash). Anyone
else holding the key (the payment service, an auditor, a notary) can then confirm the log
was not rewritten wholesale. Without a key the chain proves internal consistency only: whoever
controls the journal could rebuild a consistent fake chain, or drop entries off the end, and
verify() says signed=None. The recorded checks are the gate's own attestations that it ran
them; a signature binds those attestations to the key holder, it does not re-run them.
