The short way in: gate any function that has a side effect.

    @gate.effect(key=lambda order, amount: f"refund:{order}",
                 premises=lambda order, amount: {"refunded": refunded_total(order)},

`key` names the approved request, so a retry or a re-decided amount maps to the same
effect. `premises` reads the facts the decision depends on: they are saved when the call
is made and read again right before the effect is sent, including after a crash.
Say how the service cooperates: `dedupes=True` if you pass `idempotency_key` through
(tier 1), `lookup=` a function answering "did this effect already happen?" (tier 2),
neither for tier 3. `allowed=` is checked at dispatch and again at recovery.

Any of these functions that declares an `idempotency_key` parameter receives the effect
id, so `premises` can leave the effect's own result out of its facts. Arguments and facts
must be JSON-serializable: they are written to the journal.
