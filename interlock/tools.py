"""
Interlock around a tool list, and what every tool integration shares: a gated tool built from a config,
and what the agent is told when a call is not sent.

    tools = protect({"get_order": get_order, "create_refund": create_refund, "find_refund": find_refund},
                    config)                  # the same config as interlock.mcp.json (see mcp_proxy.py)
    tools.recover()                          # once, on startup
    out = tools["create_refund"](order_id="881", amount=20)

That covers OpenAI and Anthropic tool calling, or any loop that maps a tool name to a function: call
tools[name](**arguments) and hand `out["message"]` back to the model as the tool result. Tools not
named in the config pass through untouched. `out` is:

    ok          True if the action happened, on this call or an earlier one (never twice)
    status      the gate's status
    result      what the tool returned, when it ran on this call
    message     one line for the model
    repair      when not sent: {"changed": [...], "may_retry": bool, "next": "..."}
    escalation  for a refusal or AMBIGUOUS: escalation.explain(), the structured changes
    receipt     the four facts (journal.receipt)

A tool function returns normally when it worked, raises ToolError when the service said no (settled,
never resent), and any other exception means the outcome is unknown: recovery settles it.
Premise reads must include every configured field; a lookup's configured `found` field must be a boolean.
Failed or incomplete reads leave the action unsent or unresolved until a successful read can settle it.

When the agent reads the premises tool itself (through this tool list or the MCP proxy), a later call
is proposed on the facts it read, not on a fresh read, so a change between the agent's read and its call
is caught as well as one between the call and the send.

`approval` in a tool's config, {"tool": "get_approval", "arguments": {"order_id": "order_id"}, "attempts": 3},
names a read tool that returns the approval (approvals.Envelope) from the system of record. With it, a
refused call says what changed and whether a corrected call may go: one that fits the approval is sent,
once, and `attempts` (optional) caps how many distinct calls may be tried. Without it, a refused request
stays refused until a person decides again.
