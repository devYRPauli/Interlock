"""
Approvals that shrink.

Today a person approves every agent refund. Much of what that person checks is
mechanical: is the order still eligible, was it already refunded, is this still allowed.
The gate checks those at the moment of sending. So the work splits three ways:

    rules      decide which requests need a person at all (amount limit, flagged customer)
    the gate   re-checks the facts and the authority right before the effect, and after a crash
    the queue  holds only what needs judgment, or what nobody could verify

A human approval is recorded as the authority the effect runs under, and the facts the
approver saw become its premises. If those facts change before the refund goes out
(support already refunded it, the order was cancelled), the gate refuses and the item
comes back to the queue saying so. Approvals can expire (`max_age`) and approvers can be
removed; both are checked when the effect is sent, not when the button was clicked.

Escalations and decisions live on the effect's journal chain, not in this object. Routes
send an escalation to a group, only that group decides it, and an unanswered one moves up
the route's chain after its SLA. `queue` and `approved` are a cache of the journal, so a
restarted inbox (or a second one) rebuilds them and never loses or duplicates an escalation.

    inbox = Inbox(gate, capture=lambda r: api.capture(r["order"]),
                  effect=lambda r: {"order": r["order"], "amount": r["amount"]},
                  rules=[Rule("under $50", lambda r, facts: r["amount"] <= 50)],
                  routes=[Route("large", ["controller", "finance-manager"], lambda i: i["request"]["amount"] > 200, sla=4 * 3600)])
    inbox.submit(request)             # runs now, or waits for a person
    inbox.approve(request_id, "alice")

Two lease stores, never mixed on one chain: Authority (a person approved this exact payload) backs
Inbox; Envelope (the system of record bounds a payload the agent picks) backs easy and tools.

    One approval, several attempts, at most one of them sent.

    A refused effect keeps its identity, so an agent cannot re-decide it (gate.py, I5). Under an
    Envelope each distinct decision is its own effect id, all bound to one approval: the agent may
    correct itself after a refusal, and the gate still sends only what fits the approval, once.

        {"id": "case-4471", "match": {"order_id": "881"}, "max": {"amount": 20}, "expires": 1789000000}

    The approval comes from the system of record, never from the model. `max` is what may still be
    sent, so compute it from the world (approved minus already refunded), not from the case alone.
    The gate asks, as a lease store:

        allows(approval, effect)   live (not expired, not revoked) and the effect fits match and max
        authority(approval)        the approval id, so premises bind to it, not to one attempt
        reserve(approval, eid, e)  the first attempt to reach dispatch takes the approval; any other is
                                   refused. A reservation is never given back: once something may have
                                   been sent, a different attempt needs a new approval

    `fields(effect)` returns the effect's named values (default: the effect itself). `attempts` caps the
    distinct effects tried under one approval: the first `attempts` are judged on their merits, any later
    one is refused, so a model that keeps re-deciding is stopped by the gate, not only by its own loop.
    An attempt is the approval's "attempt" key when present (easy.py puts the request id there, so the
    same arguments re-sent after a refusal count again), otherwise a hash of the effect.
