"""
The append-only decision log. The one idea everything rests on:

    write what you are about to do, to disk, BEFORE you do it.

Entry kinds (the four facts from the brief, plus the failure states):

    PROPOSED    an agent produced an effect + the premises it relied on
    AUTHORIZED  the lease it holds was live at this instant
    DISPATCHED  we are about to apply the effect  (durable BEFORE applying)
    COMMITTED   the effect is applied and confirmed
    REFUSED     a premise, lease, claim, or payload-binding check failed; nothing applied
    AMBIGUOUS   we crashed mid-effect and cannot determine what happened
    ESCALATED   sent to a person: why, what changed, the facts shown, who it was routed to
    DECIDED     a person answered an escalation (approve, reject or repair)
    CONFIRMED   the target itself confirmed the effect (evidence only, never control flow)

Mapping to the team spec's state names (docs/team-notes/refund-spec-shawn.md):
    Prepared = PROPOSED+AUTHORIZED · In flight = DISPATCHED · Confirmed = COMMITTED
    Needs reconciliation = AMBIGUOUS · Rejected = REFUSED

Because DISPATCHED is durable before the effect exists, recovery can always
find "things we started and never confirmed". Nothing else in the system
needs to remember anything.

Two backends, one set of queries:
    Journal         append-only JSONL file, fsync'd, flock'd (one machine, many processes)
    SqliteJournal   a .db file in WAL mode (many workers sharing one database)

Three decisions must be atomic across workers, and are on both backends:
    dispatch  "send this effect, unless it is in flight, resolved, or recorded with another payload",
              which also claims the effect for the sender
    claim     "I will recover this effect", granted only if nobody holds a live claim
    release   give a claim up once the effect is resolved
A claim expires after its ttl, so a crashed sender or recoverer cannot block an effect forever.
A send, and a resend during recovery, must finish inside that ttl: time targets out sooner.

    The identity of an effect is fixed at the moment it is approved, and never
    derived from a model output or a retry.

    Two cases:
      - the proposal carries a request_id (an approved request supplied by the
        application, e.g. a support case authorising one $20 refund): the effect
        id is derived from that. A model that re-decides "$30" on retry produces
        the SAME effect id with a DIFFERENT payload, which the gate rejects.
      - no request_id (e.g. an agent's diff): the effect id is the hash of the
        decision content, so the same decision from any agent or retry is one effect.

    Either way: one approved decision -> one effect id -> at most one committed
    effect. This is why "preserve decision history" and "prevent duplicate
    effects" are one mechanism and not two.
