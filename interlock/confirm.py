"""
Target-confirmed receipts: the target itself says the refund exists, on the effect's own chain.

Two ways in, one record (CONFIRMED):
    confirm_event      a Stripe webhook, trusted only once its Stripe-Signature verifies
    confirm_by_lookup  the refunds list, for users without a webhook endpoint

The signature is HMAC-SHA256 over "t.raw_body" keyed by the endpoint's whsec_ secret. Every v1 is
tried (secret rotation sends one per secret), other schemes are ignored so nobody can downgrade to
v0, and the timestamp must sit inside the tolerance, so an old signed event can't be replayed.

A refund is matched to its effect by metadata interlock_effect_id, then must name the payment the send recorded,
the amount that was sent and, once committed, the refund id the commit recorded. Stripe does not
deliver in order, so a status behind the one recorded (pending after succeeded, succeeded after
failed) is ignored. Anything unsigned or mismatched writes nothing. CONFIRMED is
evidence only: it never closes a dispatch, and the gate and inbox never read it. It stores ids,
status and amount, never the payload or the signature header, so auditors re-fetch the event.

Test mode only: live-mode events are refused.
