"""
Receipts to a BigQuery table, one row per journal entry. Stdlib only.

Two ways in, same rows:

    merge()   a MERGE on entry_hash through jobs.query. A row whose entry_hash the table already holds is not
              inserted again, so exporting the same receipt a second time adds no rows (verified live with two
              back-to-back merges, results/export_live.md). Two merges running at the same moment were not tested:
              if exports can overlap, read through DEDUP_VIEW_SQL. Needs DML, so not the BigQuery sandbox.
    stream()  tabledata.insertAll with insertId = <effect id>-<entry hash>. Google documents insertId dedup as best
              effort for about a minute, so the table can hold duplicates. Read through DEDUP_VIEW_SQL, which keeps
              one row per entry_hash.

entry_json keeps each entry byte for byte, so receipts.verify() can re-run on rows read back. AUDIT_QUERIES are the
queries docs/08-compliance-mapping.md shows each role; experiments/export_live.py runs them against the live table.
