"""
Receipts to Google Cloud Logging (entries.write). Stdlib only.

One LogEntry per journal entry, plus one RECEIPT entry per bundle with verify()'s result:

    logName      projects/P/logs/interlock-receipts
    insertId     <effect id>-<entry hash>
    timestamp    the entry's own recorded time. Logging treats entries with the same insertId AND timestamp
                 as duplicates and removes them from a query result. That is all Google promises: "there are no
                 guarantees of de-duplication in the export of logs", so a sink (to BigQuery, Pub/Sub or a SIEM)
                 can deliver a re-exported entry twice. Consumers of a sink dedupe on insertId.
    operation    id = effect id, producer = interlock: one effect's entries group together
    labels       interlock_effect_id, interlock_kind, interlock_agent, interlock_lease, interlock_state
                 (the effect's state after this entry: the last entry carries the final state)
    trace/spanId the ids the OTLP exporter gives this effect, so the log lines open the span
    jsonPayload  the journal entry, unchanged

Entries land in the project's _Default bucket (30 days unless changed). Audit retention is the customer's
log bucket or sink, not this module.
