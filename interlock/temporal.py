"""
Interlock inside a Temporal activity. Temporal owns the retries; the gate decides whether a
retry may send.

    from interlock.temporal import gated

    @activity.defn
    def refund(order_id: str, amount: int) -> str:
        return gated(gate, proposal_for(order_id, amount))

Each attempt first recovers this effect if an earlier attempt crashed with it in flight,
and only otherwise submits. Outcomes map onto Temporal's retry policy:
    committed, or already committed   return the status
    refused, or ambiguous             non-retryable ApplicationError: retrying cannot change it
    still in flight, or unresolved    retryable ApplicationError: an earlier attempt still holds
                                      the effect; Temporal should try again after it settles
Pass raise_on_refusal=False to get the status string back instead.
experiments/temporal_live.py runs this on a real Temporal server. temporalio is optional.
