"""
EffectTarget: a simulated payments API. Effects are refunds.

The brief says a mock that always behaves perfectly proves nothing, so this
one is configurable to the three real-world levels of cooperation:

    tier 1  accepts an idempotency key and dedupes on it   (Stripe with Idempotency-Key)
    tier 2  no dedup, but refunds can be looked up by ref  (most APIs with a GET)
    tier 3  no dedup, no lookup                            (fire-and-forget: email,
                                                            webhooks, many internal services)

Premises an agent captures: the order's eligibility and amount as it saw them.
