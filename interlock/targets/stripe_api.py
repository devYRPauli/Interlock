"""
EffectTarget: real Stripe refunds against one PaymentIntent. Test-mode keys only.

Tier 1 with a lookup: Stripe dedupes on the Idempotency-Key header (for 24h), and
refunds can be listed by PaymentIntent and matched on metadata, so recovery can ask
Stripe what it has even after the key window.

Premise captured: how much has been refunded on this payment by anyone other than this
effect. A refund issued by hand from the dashboard changes that number; our own does not.
This detects that the payment's refunds changed after the decision. It does not recognize a
hand refund as the same action: an unrelated refund on the payment refuses too, and a person
re-approves.

Standard library only, like the rest of the repo.
