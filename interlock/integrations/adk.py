"""
Interlock inside Google ADK (Agent Development Kit): the gate runs a tool's effect from a tool callback.

    guard = Guard(".interlock/adk", leases)
    guard.gate("issue_refund",
               target_for=lambda effect: StripeRefunds(client, effect["payment_intent"]),
               proposal=lambda args, tool_context: {"lease": ..., "request_id": ..., "premises": ..., "effect": ...})
    agent = LlmAgent(..., tools=[issue_refund], before_tool_callback=guard.before_tool_callback)
    # or once for every agent in the app:  App(..., plugins=[guard.plugin()])
    guard.recover()                     # once, when the agent process starts

For a gated tool the callback does the send itself, through the gate, and returns the outcome as the tool
response. ADK skips the tool body whenever a before callback returns a dict, so the function in `tools=[...]`
only gives the model its schema. The effect is `target.apply`, the same EffectTarget interface as targets/.
The outcome is recorded in the journal by the gate, not inferred in an after callback: ADK runs after
callbacks even when a before callback skipped the tool, so they cannot tell whether anything was sent.

`proposal(args, tool_context)` is called at the tool call, the moment the model decided. It returns the
proposal the gate expects (see gate.py). Take `premises` from what the model read (for example facts a lookup
tool saved in `tool_context.state`), and `request_id` from the business action rather than
`function_call_id`, so the same approved action is one effect however the call is replayed. `agent` defaults
to the ADK agent, invocation and function call, so the receipt records which call proposed it.

Crashes. ADK's own resume (`ResumabilityConfig(is_resumable=True)` and `run_async(invocation_id=...)`) replays
a tool call that never answered, and its docs say the replayed tool must be idempotent. Replayed here, the
callback first recovers the effect if an earlier send is unresolved, and only otherwise submits: premises and
lease are re-checked, and a send that already landed is reported, not repeated. A send whose process died
holds its claim for claim_ttl; the callback waits that out rather than risk a second send.

google.adk is imported only by plugin(); the rest is standard library.
