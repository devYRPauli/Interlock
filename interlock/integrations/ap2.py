"""
AP2 mandates as Interlock leases: the gate re-verifies the mandate when the effect is sent, and again after a crash.

AP2 (Agent Payments Protocol, v0.2) carries proof of what was authorized: an open Payment Mandate signed by a
trusted surface (amount range, allowed payees and instruments, expiry, and the agent's key in `cnf`), closed by
the agent with the exact payment. AP2 keeps no state. Its verifier accepts the same presentation twice, it has
no revocation, and it cannot know whether the payment already happened. This store and the gate add, at the
moment of the effect:

    - revocation of a closed or an open mandate (a row here)
    - the nonce is issued by this store (challenge()) and good for one register(), not chosen by the agent
    - one closed mandate pays one effect id, and the effects under one open mandate together stay within its
      AmountRange max (reserve(), called by the gate right before it sends). AP2 defines that range per payment;
      reading it as the open mandate's total is this adapter's policy. An open mandate with no AmountRange max
      has no total to count against, so it authorizes nothing here
    - authority(lease) is the open mandate, so an agent that re-closes the same mandate after a refusal is held
      to the facts of its first decision, and refused again. A new open mandate, from a person, is a new decision

    mandates = Mandates("mandates.db", trusted_keys={"finance-1": public_jwk_json}, audience="interlock",
                        observe=stripe_payment(client))  # reads the PaymentIntent the target will refund
    nonce = mandates.challenge()                     # hand to the agent; it closes the mandate with this nonce
    lease = mandates.register(chain, nonce)          # the closed-mandate reference, as AP2 receipts use it
    gate = Gate(target, "journal.db", mandates)      # proposal["lease"] = lease
    mandates.revoke(open_mandate_id(chain))          # whoever holds operational authority withdraws it

The effect must name what it pays: amount (integer minor units), currency, payee (id), instrument (id) and
transaction_id. allows(lease, effect) is True only if, when the gate asks:

    - the chain verifies against a trusted root key, looked up by `kid` in `trusted_keys` (policy config, never
      the agent): every hop's signature, the sd_hash binding between hops, aud and nonce on the closed hop, and
      exp and iat with zero clock skew (the SDK's default accepts 300 s past expiry)
    - AP2's own evaluator finds no violation of the open mandate's constraints and pre-set claims. No usage
      context is passed, so budget and recurrence constraints always fail: counting spend is not done here yet
    - the effect's fields equal the closed mandate's: amount, currency, payee, instrument, transaction_id
    - observe(effect) reads the payment the target will actually act on from the system of record (for Stripe,
      stripe_payment() reads the PaymentIntent in effect["payment_intent"]), and its transaction id, payee,
      instrument and currency are the mandate's too. Without observe nothing is allowed: the effect's fields are
      the caller's, and a refund sent to another customer's payment could otherwise match them
    - the open mandate has an AmountRange with a max
    - neither the closed mandate nor the open mandate it closes is revoked in this store

describe(lease) is recorded by the gate next to every check: the mandate reference and open-mandate id, the
root kid, cap, payee, instrument, expiry, revocation, and every problem found. So a receipt joins to an AP2
Payment Receipt on `reference`, and shows what was checked when the effect fired.

What is cryptographic and what is not. The signatures, hop binding, aud, nonce and expiry are verified by the
AP2 SDK against the trusted key. Revocation is a row in this store, trusted as far as the store is. That the
effect matches the mandate is a comparison, not a signature: with the effect's fields, and with what observe
reads from the payment provider. observe must read the same object the target sends to. AP2 v0.2 defines no
refund mandate; using a Payment Mandate to authorize a refund payout is this adapter's convention, not AP2's.
