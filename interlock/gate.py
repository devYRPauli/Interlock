"""
The commit gate: the only path by which an effect reaches the world.

A proposal:

    {"agent": "B",
     "lease": "L-B",
     "premises": {...},   # what the agent assumed, captured at decision time
     "effect": {...}}     # what it wants done (target-specific payload)

The gate is generic over an EffectTarget (see targets/). A target declares
how much it cooperates:

    tier 1  dedupes on the effect id             -> safe retry, exactly-once effect
    tier 2  no dedup, but queryable by effect id  -> exactly-once with a recovery read
    tier 3  neither                               -> crash-before-ack is undecidable;
                                                     the gate can only refuse to guess

Invariants (the correctness contract):

    I1  no effect without a journaled decision (DISPATCHED on disk before apply)
    I2  no duplicate effect (an effect id reaches COMMITTED at most once, and is never sent
        while an earlier send of it is unresolved, by this worker or any other)
    I3  no stale premise lands (premises re-validated against the target at commit)
    I4  no effect under a dead lease (lease checked at dispatch, not just proposal); a store with
        reserve() binds one approval to one effect id after premises and before dispatch, never after
    I5  payload binding: once a decision is recorded for an effect id, a later proposal
        with the same id and a different payload is rejected, never silently applied.
        (A model that re-decides "$30" on retry cannot replace the recorded "$20".)
    I6  no duplicate implementation: an effect that defines a symbol already defined,
        or claimed by another live agent, is refused (MAST's top failure mode, step
        repetition, caught with zero model calls)
    I7  decision binding: once an effect has been escalated it is dispatched only under a person's
        recorded approval of its LATEST escalation, by a member of that escalation's group (checked
        when deciding and again at dispatch), with that escalation's facts as premises. Policy never
        sends it again.
    I8  repairs are new decisions: a repair with a different payload is a new effect id, accepted only
        while the original never landed, and accepting it closes the original. A closed effect is never
        dispatched.
    P'  every refused or unverifiable outcome of an inbox-owned effect ends in exactly one open
        escalation, derived from the journal, so a crash or a second inbox can neither lose nor
        duplicate it.
    P   progress: valid proposals commit; recovery resolves every in-flight effect
        to COMMITTED, REFUSED or AMBIGUOUS, re-checks lease and premises before any
        resend (the outage is when the world moves), and never re-applies blindly

Premises are bound to a decision under an authority. A retry under the same lease is
checked against the premises the decision was first recorded with; a new authority (a
person approving after a refusal) is a new decision and brings the facts that person saw.
Recovery re-checks exactly the lease and premises the send was dispatched under.

Every send holds a claim on its effect until it is resolved. Recovery takes an effect
over only after that claim expires (claim_ttl), so an effect still being applied is
never sent a second time. Targets must time out well inside claim_ttl.
